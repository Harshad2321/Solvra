## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview

Solvra follows a pipeline architecture with five main components:

```
Input Problem → Preprocessing → Reasoning Agent → Verification → Output + Trace
                                      ↓
                              Tool Selection
                              ┌─────┴─────┐
                        MathSolver  LogicSolver  SpatialSolver  SequenceSolver
```

### 1.2 Component Details

#### Preprocessing Module (`preprocess.py`)
- Cleans and normalizes text
- Extracts numerical values, time durations, distances
- Identifies problem characteristics (math, spatial, logic, etc.)
- Generates problem flags for tool selection

**Key Features**:
- Pattern-based number extraction
- Topic-based classification
- Multi-feature extraction (numbers, sequences, spatial terms)

#### Reasoning Agent (`reasoning_agent.py`)
- Central orchestrator for problem-solving
- Decomposes problems into subproblems
- Selects appropriate tools
- Synthesizes final answers

**Decomposition Strategy**:
1. Identify problem type from topic and keywords
2. Break into 2-4 subproblems
3. Assign each subproblem to appropriate solver
4. Aggregate results

**Tool Selection Logic**:
```python
Priority order:
1. Sequence problems → SequenceSolver
2. Spatial keywords → SpatialSolver  
3. Logic/riddle keywords → LogicSolver
4. Optimization/numbers → MathSolver
5. Default → LogicSolver
```

#### Solver Modules (`solver.py`)

**MathSolver**:
- Symbolic equation solving (SymPy)
- Traveling salesman problems (brute force for small n)
- Rate problems (combined rates)
- Task scheduling optimization

**LogicSolver**:
- Truth-teller/liar problems
- Forward-chaining logical deduction
- Pattern matching for classic riddles

**SpatialSolver**:
- 3D cube face counting
- Manhattan distance calculations
- Room navigation tracking

**SequenceSolver**:
- Arithmetic sequence detection
- Geometric sequence detection
- Recursive pattern identification (Fibonacci-like)
- Polynomial fitting for complex patterns

#### Verification Module (`verifier.py`)
- Numerical consistency checks
- Logical consistency validation
- Domain-specific verification (cubes, sequences)
- Correction heuristics

**Verification Strategies**:
1. Check predicted value is in reasonable range
2. Verify option validity
3. Check sequence patterns match predictions
4. Validate spatial constraints
5. Apply corrections if multiple checks fail

#### Trace Logger (`trace_logger.py`)
- Logs every reasoning step
- Generates JSON, CSV, and HTML reports
- Provides topic-wise performance analysis
- Enables debugging and improvement

## 2. Reasoning Methodology

### 2.1 Problem Decomposition

Each problem is broken down based on its topic:

**Optimization Problems**:
1. Extract constraints
2. Identify objective function
3. Evaluate options
4. Select optimal

**Spatial Problems**:
1. Visualize configuration
2. Extract dimensions
3. Track transformations
4. Calculate result

**Sequence Problems**:
1. Extract sequence
2. Identify pattern type
3. Predict next values
4. Verify consistency

**Logic Problems**:
1. Extract statements
2. Identify constraints
3. Apply deduction
4. Check contradictions

### 2.2 Symbolic Reasoning

For mathematical problems, Solvra uses SymPy for exact symbolic computation:

```python
# Example: Solve system of equations
x, y = symbols('x y')
eq1 = Eq(x + y, 10)
eq2 = Eq(2*x - y, 5)
solution = solve([eq1, eq2], [x, y])
```

This provides exact answers without floating-point errors.

### 2.3 Pattern Recognition

For sequences, multiple pattern types are tested:

1. **Arithmetic**: Check if differences are constant
2. **Geometric**: Check if ratios are constant
3. **Recursive**: Check Fibonacci-like patterns
4. **Polynomial**: Fit quadratic/cubic curves

### 2.4 Heuristic Rules

Topic-specific heuristics improve accuracy:

- **Cube painting**: Total small cubes = n³, corners = 8
- **Truth-teller/liar**: "What would the other say?" → opposite
- **Optimization**: "minimum" → choose smallest option
- **Riddles**: Look for wordplay and lateral thinking

## 3. Verification & Quality Control

### 3.1 Verification Pipeline

Every prediction goes through verification:

1. **Numerical Consistency**: Is the value reasonable?
2. **Option Validity**: Does the option exist?
3. **Logical Consistency**: Do steps follow logically?
4. **Domain-Specific**: Topic-specific checks

### 3.2 Correction Heuristics

If verification fails:
1. Recalculate using alternate method
2. Check training examples for similar patterns
3. Apply fallback strategies (e.g., middle option)

### 3.3 Quality Metrics

- Verification pass rate
- Correction frequency
- Topic-wise accuracy
- Reasoning step count
