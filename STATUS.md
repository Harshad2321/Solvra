## 🎯 Next Steps for Hackathon

### Phase 1: Initial Testing (Now - 10 mins)
1. ✅ Run demo.py to see system in action
2. ✅ Run main.py with 50 training samples
3. ✅ Review HTML report in `reports/`
4. ✅ Check predictions in `data/predictions.csv`

### Phase 2: Optimization (10-30 mins)
1. Review failed cases in HTML report
2. Adjust solver logic for weak topics
3. Fine-tune verification heuristics
4. Test improvements

### Phase 3: Full Run (5-10 mins)
1. Edit `src/main.py` line 93: change `train_samples=50` to `train_samples=384`
2. Run full pipeline
3. Generate final predictions
4. Review all reports

### Phase 4: Presentation Prep (15-30 mins)
1. Practice demo.py presentation (aim for 3-4 minutes)
2. Prepare talking points:
   - Modular architecture
   - Explainable reasoning
   - Self-verification
   - No black-box LLMs
3. Prepare to show HTML report
4. Have predictions.csv ready

## 📝 Configuration Options

### Adjust Training Size
Edit `src/main.py` line 93:
```python
pipeline.run_full_pipeline(
    train_samples=50,  # Change to 100, 200, or 384
    generate_test_predictions=True
)
```

### Enable More Detailed Logging
Edit `src/main.py` line 93:
```python
# In predict_test_set method
self.predict_test_set(save_traces=True)  # Already True
```

## 🏆 Winning Strategy

### What Makes Solvra Stand Out

1. **Complete Transparency**: Every decision is traceable
2. **Self-Correcting**: Built-in verification catches errors
3. **Modular**: Easy to understand and extend
4. **Resource Efficient**: No GPU needed, runs locally
5. **Explainable**: Shows reasoning trace for every answer

### Technical Highlights

- Symbolic math (SymPy) for exact computation
- Pattern recognition for sequences
- Spatial reasoning for 3D problems
- Optimization algorithms for planning
- Verification pipeline with correction heuristics

### Novel Contributions

- Hybrid symbolic + rule-based + heuristic approach
- Multi-stage verification with automatic correction
- Complete reasoning trace generation
- Topic-specific solver selection

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Module not found
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the `src` directory
```powershell
cd c:\Users\harsh\Desktop\Solvra\src
```

### Issue: Low accuracy on specific topics
**Solution**: 
1. Check HTML report for failed examples
2. Review reasoning traces
3. Adjust solver logic in `solver.py`
4. Add verification rules in `verifier.py`

### Issue: Slow performance
**Solution**: Reduce training samples to 20-30 for testing
