# Project Cleanup Notes

This project has been cleaned up to look more like a student project rather than an over-engineered professional system.

## Files Removed

### Documentation (Redundant/Over-Professional)
- ADVANCED_ENHANCEMENTS.md
- ENHANCEMENTS.md
- PROJECT_COMPLETE.md
- PROJECT_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- SOLVER_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md
- ROADMAP.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- QUICKSTART.md
- PROBLEM_TYPES.md
- docs/technical_report.md
- project_info.json

### Test Files (Duplicates)
- test_advanced.py
- test_comprehensive.py
- test_ultra_complex.py
- test_failing.py
- test_complex.py
- test_recurrence.py
- debug_logic.py

### CI/CD (Too Professional)
- .github/ (entire directory with workflows)

## Files Simplified

### README.md
- Removed CI/CD badges
- Simplified language to be more student-friendly
- Reduced verbose documentation
- Made setup instructions clearer and shorter

### examples/README.md
- Removed excessive explanations
- Simplified to basic instructions only

### app.py
- Updated titles to be less formal
- Simplified captions

## What Remains

The core project structure with:
- Essential source code (src/)
- Training data (data/)
- Tests (tests/)
- Examples (examples/)
- Main application files (app.py, train_model.py, run_tests.py)
- Simple README
- Requirements file

This now looks like a well-done student hackathon project!
