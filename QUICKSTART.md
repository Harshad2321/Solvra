# üöÄ Solvra Quick Start Guide

Get Solvra up and running in 5 minutes!

---

## Step 1: Environment Setup (2 minutes)

### Open PowerShell in VS Code

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\harsh\Desktop\Solvra

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If you get execution policy error, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install spaCy language model (optional)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

**Expected output**: All packages installed successfully

---

## Step 3: Quick Test (1 minute)

### Option A: Run Demo (Recommended for presentation practice)

```powershell
cd src
python demo.py
```

This shows an interactive 3-5 minute demo perfect for the hackathon presentation!

### Option B: Run Full Pipeline

```powershell
cd src
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Analyze 50 training examples
3. Generate predictions for test set
4. Create detailed reports

**First run takes**: ~2-5 minutes

---

## Step 4: View Results

### Check Console Output
You'll see real-time progress and accuracy metrics.

### Open HTML Report
```powershell
# Navigate to reports folder
cd ..\reports

# Open the latest HTML report (replace timestamp)
start reasoning_report_*.html
```

The HTML report shows:
- Overall accuracy
- Detailed reasoning traces
- Step-by-step explanations

### Check Predictions
```powershell
# View predictions
cd ..\data
type predictions.csv | Select-Object -First 20
```

---

## Common Commands

### Run with Different Training Size

Edit `src/main.py`, line 93:
```python
pipeline.run_full_pipeline(
    train_samples=100,  # Change this number (max 534)
    generate_test_predictions=True
)
```

### Test Individual Component

```powershell
cd src

# Test preprocessing
python preprocess.py

# Test solvers
python solver.py

# Test reasoning agent
python reasoning_agent.py

# Test verifier
python verifier.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "python is not recognized"
**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Check Python installation
py --version

# Use 'py' instead of 'python'
py -m venv venv
```

### Issue: Import errors
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Cannot load module"
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the src directory
cd src
python main.py
```

### Issue: Memory error
**Solution**: Reduce training samples in `main.py` to 20-30

## File Locations

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Source code | `src/*.py` |
| Training data | `data/train.csv` |
| Test data | `data/test.csv` |
| Predictions | `data/predictions.csv` |
| Reports | `reports/*.html` |
| Traces | `reports/*.json` |

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Run quick test
2. ‚úÖ Review sample output
3. ‚úÖ Run demo for practice
4. ‚úÖ Increase training samples
5. ‚úÖ Review HTML report
6. ‚úÖ Generate final predictions
7. ‚úÖ Prepare presentation

---

## Presentation Checklist

- [ ] Run `python demo.py` and practice timing (aim for 3-4 minutes)
- [ ] Open HTML report in browser for showing results
- [ ] Have `predictions.csv` ready to show
- [ ] Prepare to explain system architecture diagram
- [ ] Ready to discuss novel features (explainability, verification)

---

## Quick Commands Cheat Sheet

```powershell
# Activate environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run demo
cd src; python demo.py

# Run full pipeline
cd src; python main.py

# Run with more training data
# (Edit main.py first)
cd src; python main.py

# View results
cd ..\reports; start reasoning_report_*.html

# Check predictions
cd ..\data; type predictions.csv

# Deactivate environment
deactivate
```

## Performance Tips

### For Speed
- Use 20-50 training samples for testing
- Use 100-200 for development
- Use full 534 for final submission

### For Accuracy
- Review failed cases in HTML report
- Adjust heuristics in `verifier.py`
- Add domain rules in `solver.py`

### For Demo
- Run `demo.py` - it's optimized for presentation
- Practice the flow (3-5 minutes)
- Know your talking points

## Help & Support

If stuck:
1. Check this guide
2. Read README.md
3. Check code comments in `src/*.py`
4. Review error messages carefully

---

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ All packages installed without errors  
‚úÖ `python main.py` completes successfully  
‚úÖ HTML report generated  
‚úÖ `predictions.csv` has 101 rows  
‚úÖ Demo runs smoothly  

---

## Final Submission Preparation

1. **Run full pipeline**:
```powershell
cd src
# Edit main.py: train_samples=534
python main.py
```

2. **Verify output**:
- Check `data/predictions.csv` has 101 predictions
- Review HTML report for quality
- Verify format matches `data/output.csv`

3. **Package submission**:
- `predictions.csv` (required)
- Technical report (generated in `reports/`)
- Demo video or live demo

4. **Practice presentation**:
- 3-5 minutes
- Show live demo
- Explain architecture
- Highlight novel features
