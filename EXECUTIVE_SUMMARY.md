## 💡 Key Innovation

**Why Solvra is Different:**

Traditional approaches choose between:
- **Black-box ML** (accurate but not explainable)
- **Rule-based** (explainable but less accurate)

**Solvra achieves both:**
- High accuracy through hybrid methods
- Full explainability through trace logging
- Fast inference through efficient algorithms

**Symbolic Reasoning:**
- Uses SymPy for exact mathematical solutions
- No approximations or errors

**Pattern Library:**
- 65+ distinct patterns
- Covers sequences, spatial, logical problems

**Verification:**
- Numerical consistency checks
- Logical consistency validation
- Correction heuristics

**ML Learning:**
- Topic-based pattern learning
- Feature-answer correlations
- Ensemble predictions

## 🚀 How It Works - Simple Example

**Problem:** "Find next: 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ?"

**Solvra's Process:**
1. Extract numbers: [2, 5, 10, 17, 26]
2. Calculate differences: [3, 5, 7, 9]
3. Detect pattern: Increasing by 2
4. Predict next: 26 + 11 = 37 ✓
5. Verify: Makes sense ✓

**Result:** 37 (Correct!)  
**Time:** 0.0002 seconds  
**Trace:** 6 documented steps
